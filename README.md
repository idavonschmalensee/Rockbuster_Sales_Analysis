# Rockbuster_Stealth_Analysis
Rockbuster   Stealth   LLC   is   a   movie   rental   company   that is created for educational purposes for this analysis.  The   Rockbuster  Stealth   management   team   is   planning   to   use   its  
existing   movie   licenses  for their  online   video   rental   service.  I analyse the data frames as if I was hired as a data analyst by   Rockbuster   Stealth’s   
business   intelligence   (BI)   department   to   help   with   the   launch   strategy.   The   BI   department   helps   other  
departments,   from   inventory   to   film. I’ll   use   SQL   to   analyze   the   data   and   answer   any   ad-hoc   business   questions   that   other  
departments   may   have.
